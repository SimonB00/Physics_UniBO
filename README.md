# Physics_UniBO
Repository for materials related to the master's degree course in Physics of the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna.

In the *src* folder there is one folder for course with all the materials.
The main *.tex* file has the full name of the course.
All non-tex file are usually small codes taken from lectures

# How to contribute
You can upload anything you want by making a pull request, following many simple rules:
- you can download, modify or upload *.tex* files as you want, uploading the changes
- every new *.tex* file must be a chapter to be included in the main file of the course
- avoid, if possible, to include images in *.tex* files. If you cannot avoid this, simply upload the images into the same folder as the *.tex*
- programming lectures, especially the python ones, are preferable in the *.ipynb* format (Jupyter notebook)
